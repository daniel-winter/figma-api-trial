# figma-api-trial

Small demo to illustrate how to fetch data with the figma API.

It's essential that you get your figma token and the figma file id and add it to a `.env` file in your repository.

Afterwards, you can start demo with `npm run start`. Now you can open the browser under: http://localhost:3001/. After some seconds you get the JSON response.
